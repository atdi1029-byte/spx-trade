SPX Trade Dashboard — Project Notes
=====================================

OVERVIEW
--------
macOS app + web dashboard for stock trading tools (SPX/stocks).
Opens all trading tools in one click and displays a live dashboard
that pulls data from the Google Sheet Trade Tracker.

FILES
-----
SPX/index.html
  - Single-file HTML dashboard (dark trading theme)
  - Fetches live data from Apps Script doGet(?action=dashboard)
  - Auto-refreshes every 60 seconds
  - Sections: Quick Stats, Action Needed, Ticker Grid, Recent Signals, Performance

RSI_Trendline_Buy (Stocks)/trade_tracker/apps_script.gs
  - Modified: added ?action=dashboard JSON endpoint to doGet()
  - Returns: tickers, recentSignals, actionNeeded, stats
  - No auth needed — same public web app URL

/Applications/SPX Trade.app
  - macOS app bundle (same structure as Trade.app for crypto)
  - Opens Chrome fullscreen with 3 tabs:
    1. Dashboard (file://...SPX/index.html)
    2. TradingView (stock charts)
    3. Google Sheet (Trade Tracker)

DEPLOYMENT — Apps Script
------------------------
1. Open Google Sheet → Extensions → Apps Script
2. Replace code with contents of apps_script.gs
3. Deploy → Manage deployments → Edit → New version → Deploy
4. Test: visit deployed URL with ?action=dashboard appended
   Should return JSON with tickers, stats, etc.

DEPLOYMENT — macOS App
----------------------
Already installed at /Applications/SPX Trade.app
Double-click to launch. If Chrome tabs don't open:
  - Check that Google Chrome is installed
  - The launcher script is at SPX Trade.app/Contents/MacOS/launcher

DASHBOARD DATA FLOW
--------------------
TradingView Alert → webhook POST → doPost() → Signal Log + Positions
User marks Action/Outcome in Positions → Dashboard tab formulas update
Dashboard HTML → fetch doGet(?action=dashboard) → renders all tabs as JSON

CUSTOMIZATION
-------------
- Dashboard theme: edit CSS in index.html (currently dark trading theme)
- Refresh interval: change REFRESH_INTERVAL in index.html <script> (default 60s)
- TradingView chart URL: edit launcher script in app bundle
- Google Sheet URL: edit launcher script in app bundle

API ENDPOINT
------------
URL: https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwVwBpJsq5kybfAuo8DpvODludwPehRWeT81bRe1PftdSuYCXv90FnewvIsZtCZIUv6Cg/exec
  ?action=dashboard → returns JSON dashboard data
  ?action=tasks     → returns weekly tasks from "Weekly Tasks" tab
  (no params)       → returns health check JSON
  POST with JSON    → logs trade signal

WEBSITE-ONLY FEATURES (Feb 9, 2026)
------------------------------------
Hidden on mobile via @media (max-width: 900px)

Weekly Tasks:
  - Google Sheet "Weekly Tasks" tab, Column A = tasks
  - Served via ?action=tasks endpoint
  - localStorage key: spx_weekly_todos_YYYY-MM-DD (resets each Monday)
  - Section appears between quote banner and stats bar
  - Hides when all tasks checked

4 Day Check (Open Trades):
  - 96h timer auto-starts when trade first appears
  - Shows days: 4d, 3d, 2d, 1d — then hours: 23h, 22h... for last day
  - Red "CHECK!" with glow after 4 days, click resets timer
  - "Need 4 Day" filter button flashes red with count
  - localStorage key: spx_4day_checks

Other Changes:
  - Open trades only show AFTER clicking "Entered" (filters pending action-needed)
  - OxO/TP badge positioned on right side of card
  - BUY/OxO tags made smaller (0.4rem, opacity 0.7) to reduce clutter
  - Service worker v29: network-first for HTML (prevents stale cache)
  - ALWAYS bump service-worker.js cache version when pushing changes

Updates (Feb 9, 2026 — session 2):
  - Won button now immediately closes trade as TP Hit (no more partial/CLOSE flow)
  - All dashboard writes use GET (not POST) — POST silently fails due to CORS redirects
  - Apps Script doGet handles ?action=update_position with query params
  - Fixed updatePosition_ matching: outcome updates find rows where Action=Entered (was looking for empty Action)
  - Fixed sumLockedBySide_: only sums profitLocked from TP Hit trades (was including stopped out losses)
  - Performance summary: glow effects on profit/loss values, streaks show "Win"/"Loss" not "W"/"L"
